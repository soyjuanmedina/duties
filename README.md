# Duties

Simple application to keep a list of duties for a Technical Test of Angular Fullstack position 

## TECHNICAL TEST
The purpose of this technical test is to create an end-to-end web application that allows the user
to read, create and update a to-do list of duties of any kind.

Required: A backend written either in Python, .Net Core 3.x or Node JS, using MongoDB as a
database engine. It must be able to perform read, create and update operations.

Required: A frontend developed in Angular (minimum version accepted is 11) that renders the
list of duties retrieved from the backend and allows the user to create new ones and/or modify
existing ones. Must use Reactive Forms and has to include form validations.

Required: The code is published in a public bitbucket repository from which anybody could clone
the solution.

Required: A README.md file is written with clear instructions on how to run the solution.
Note: Build and serve commands must run on all operating systems (Windows, macOS and
Linux).

Optional: The solution is also able to delete items from the to-do list.

## Deploy backend

Go into backend folder `cd backend` 

Run `npm install` to install backend dependencies

Run `npm start` to start the server in `http://localhost:3000/`.
